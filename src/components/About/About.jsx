      <p>
        Iâ€™m Rebecca Njeri Gitau, a third-year BSc. Telecommunications and Information Technology student at 
        Pwani University. I have a strong passion for Networking, Telecommunication Systems, and IT infrastructure. 
        My academic background is complemented by hands-on participation in science fairs and team sports, which have 
        helped build my teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills.
